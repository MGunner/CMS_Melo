Setting Up Your VHOST
=====================

The following is a sample VHOST you might want to consider for your project.

<VirtualHost *:80>
   DocumentRoot "/opt/lampp/htdocs/melobit/public"
   ServerName melobit.local

   # This should be omitted in the production environment
   SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV development

   <Directory "/opt/lampp/htdocs/melobit/public">
       Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
       AllowOverride All
       Order allow,deny
       Allow from all
   </Directory>

</VirtualHost>
